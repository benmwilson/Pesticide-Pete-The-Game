<p align="center">
 Pesticide Pete: The Game is a simple two-dimensional interactive point-and-click game where you fight off a hoard of corn-eating pests from ravaging your last corn field using your trusty toolbelt of pesticides! This is a simple game made with WebGL where you click on the bugs to spray them with pesticide in order to kill them before they eat all your corn!

### Completed Features
 
1. [x] The playing field starts as a circular disk centered at the origin.
2. [x] The player views the disk from above.
3. [x] Bacteria grow on the circumference of the disk starting at an arbitrary spot on the
circumference and growing out uniformly in each direction from that spot at a speed
determined by the game.
4. [x] The player needs to eradicate the bacteria by placing the mouse over the bacteria and
hitting a button.
5. [x] The effect of the poison administered is to immediately remove the poisoned bacteria.
6. [x] The game can randomly generate up to a fixed number (say 10) of different bacteria
(each with a different color).
7. [x] The bacteria appear as a crust on the circumference of the disk.
8. [x] The game gains points through the delays in the user responding and by any specific
bacteria reaching a threshold (for example, a 30-degree arc).
9. [x] The player wins if all bacteria are poisoned before any two different bacteria reach the
threshold mentioned above.
 
#### Bonus Features
 
1. [ ] The effect of the poison administered also propagates outward from the point of insertion of the position until all the bacteria are destroyed.
2. [ ] When two bacteria cultures collide, the first one to appear on the circumference dominates and consumes the later generated bacteria.
3. [ ] When a bacterial culture is hit, use a simple 2D particle system to simulate an explosion at the point where the poison is administered.
